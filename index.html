        Significance of Sports in Student’s Life Just like a diet of healthy
        nutrients is needed for nourishing the body, playing sports holds a
        great significance in enhancing our lives, especially for growing
        children. As a student, one has to face many challenges, and playing
        sports helps them cope with the exam pressure and prepare them for
        further challenges by providing them with physical and mental
        strength. Children who are indulged in physical activities sustain
        good values of mutual respect and cooperation. Playing sports teaches
        them skills such as accountability, leadership, and learning to work
        with a sense of responsibility and confidence. Sports help in
        maintaining Good Health In today’s era of excessive competition and
        changing environment, people barely care about our health and have to
